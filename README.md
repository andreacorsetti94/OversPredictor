# OversPredictor
In this project I've built 2 Models that predict if a Soccer Match will end Over 2.5 (more than 2 goals) or 
not, given a specified set of inputs.

To accomplish this, I've built a Logistic Regression Model and a Neural Network Model.
I've also realized a Custom Pre-Processor that takes a csv file formatted like the one present at the moment
in this folder ('dataset.csv') and pre-process its observations.

Big thanks to https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer for the matches data.

Enjoy!
